[Saigon Dating Project](https://www.facebook.com/saigondatingproject/) is a 3-month experimental project by a group of thirteen Vietnamese youths studying all over the globe to explore the dating and romantic relationship landscape in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Our aims are to understand people's dating behaviors and preferences specific to Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam with its very own culture and way of life. Even though "brand name" apps such as *Tinder*, *Bumble* and *OkCupid* have their presence in HCMC, their difficulty in catering for the Vietnamese audience partially explains their stigmatization and slow growth in this city. Therefore, as a predominantly HCMC-native group of young people, many of whom have been exposed to the Western cultures where dating apps are the new normal, we want to learn more about our own culture and people, and thus try out our ideas in the form of social media campaigns and dating events to see what works and what doesn't.

To accomplish this goal, we develop a [Qualtrics survey](https://bit.ly/3erPyMY) which covers a wide range of topics, from demographics, personal preferences when it comes to dating partners to a personality test based on pop-psychological classification systems, namely *Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)* and *Five Love Languages*. Towards the end of the survey, we have an optional section where we dive deep into the respondents sense of self, their concerns and challenges when it comes to romantic relationships and their opinions on dating programs/organizations. The number of responses that we have received so far exceeds our modest initial expectations, with more than 500 responses from various demographic groups.
