I major in Quantitative Economics and Political Science at Dickinson College, Class of 2021. I have been fortunate enough to have access to an education that has prepared me for both the "hard" and "soft" sides of the real world. As a Political Science major, I have learnt to think critically about political structures, the intertwining connection between politics, economy and society, as well as the multifacetedness of human relationships. As a Quantitative Economics major, I closely examine economic and financial growths and declines overtime using tools from such as "Economics-niche" as STATA to more popular and practical ones as Excel, R, Python and SQL.

As someone who loves thinking about and tinkering with problems, whether the problem be with a chair, a bike, an essay, a social pattern or a business, Data Analytics is just the right place for me. The more exposure I gain to the world of Data Analytics, the more fascinated I am with the opportunities it has to offer. Especially during such a time of digital disruptions and technological advances in the business arena, it is as if the sky is the limit. Therefore, I am excited to embark on a journey to prepare myself for a future career in the field. To deepen my knowledge, I have taken multiple online courses on Coursera (with Certificates) about data in addition to my college coursework. To apply the skills I have learnt, I have worked on a few projects of various sizes and disciplines, many of which you could find on this blog.

Besides, I am **actively** seeking an apprenticeship, internship and ultimate full-time job where I would be able to learn, grow and contribute. Please feel free to reach out to me at nguyehuo@dickinson.edu for any suggestions on how I could improve the listed projects or any opportunities!
