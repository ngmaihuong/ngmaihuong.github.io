I graduated from Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA in May 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Quantitative Economics and Political Science. For four years, I had been fortunate enough to have access to an education that always encouraged me to explore my interests and potentials as well as taught me knowledge and skills that stick, grow and allow me to  contribute to life. As a Political Science major, I have learnt to think critically about political structures, the intertwining connection between politics, economy and society, as well as the multifacetedness of human relationships. As a Quantitative Economics major, I closely examine and predict economic and financial growths and declines overtime using tools from such as "Economics-niche" as STATA to more popular and practical ones as Excel, R and Python. However, what I have learnt does not apply only in academia, but also in life, be it personal or professional. Political Science shows me that there is no problem I cannot overcome, just like there is no texts too dense to be understood, nor is structure too complicated to be broken down. Quantitative Economics shows me that I should always be reasonably skeptical of my conclusions, since just because the model and the data show me what I want to see does not mean there are no confounding factors.

As someone who loves thinking about and tinkering with problems, whether the problem be with a chair, a bike, an essay, a social pattern or a business, I like playing with data, especially big ones, because of the myriad possibilities it unfolds. During such a time of digital disruptions and technological advances in the business arena, it is as if the sky is the limit. Therefore, I create this blog as a "sandbox" for myself to explore this interest, as you will find a few projects of various sizes and disciplines that I have worked on here. I hope you find them interesting.

Please feel free to reach out to me at maihuongnguyen1603@gmail.com for any suggestions on how I could improve the listed projects, or just for a nice coffee chat!
